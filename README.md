# Auto Add Repeater

Burp extension to automatically Send new in-scope requests to Burp Repeater.

## Features

* Automate "Send To Repeater" for interesting requests (new URL, has parameters, is in-scope)
* Iterate over all requests in the Proxy history and add send them to Repeater as well (don't worry, there is a 'unique' check).
* Ignore file extensions (.js, .svg, .ico, etc)

## Roadmap

* Pretty UI
